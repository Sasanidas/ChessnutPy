# chessnutair
This is a program written in Python. You can connect your Chessnut Air eboard to your pc and play against chess engines.
At the moment we only support the Chessnut Air eboard and only via bluetooth. We tested the program with stockfish and 
the texel chess engines. Both work as intended so we can say, that all uci engines should work.

 * Supports Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) or greater
 * Supports Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43 (See Linux backend for more details)
 * OS X/macOS support via Core Bluetooth API, from at least OS X version 10.11

So far, I have only tested this software on Linux.
